## Mark Conrad

I made this webpage as a quick portfolio page, I wanted to explore web development during my nights and weekends 

I may use this as a platform to explore technologies and understand how web applications work and advancements in this domain, eventually it would be fun to test out some user authentication using zero knowledge proofs (I interned at a identity blockchain startup a couple years ago, before my current job, so this interests me) and explore what Oauth2.0 authorization is (and what are it's limitations?), and create/explore smart control-f extensions using transformer-based models (such as efforts like this https://github.com/model-zoo/shift-ctrl-f) and use this page as a canvas to explore technology that interests me and possibly others :)

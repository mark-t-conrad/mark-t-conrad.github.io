## Mark Conrad

I made this webpage as a quick portfolio page, I wanted to explore web development during my nights and weekends 

I may use this as a platform to explore technologies and understand how web applications work and advancements in this domain, eventually it would be fun to test out some user authentication new tools and explore what Oauth2.0 authorization is (and what it's limitations are), and create/explore smart control-f extensions using lightweight transformer models (such as efforts like this https://github.com/model-zoo/shift-ctrl-f). I hope to use this page as a canvas and explore technology that interests me and hopefully you too :)
